This is the electronic supplement for my piece "And Where Do I Seek the Dolphin Of Wisdom?" composed for clarinet, electronics, and projection

It uses data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association to influence a lot of the logic and pacing of the electronics and animation.
The piece is inspired by Ilona Selke's book "Wisdom of the Dolphins. Discovering the Mystery of the Holographic Universe" which entertains the notion that dolphins are possess a universal wisdom that humans can tap into once we have earned their trust.
